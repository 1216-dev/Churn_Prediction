# Churn_Prediction
# Churn Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using deep learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's services or products. By predicting churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain their valuable customers.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the code.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
